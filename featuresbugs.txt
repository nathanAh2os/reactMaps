Future Features

1) Add labels to planets

2) Add minimum size to planets if scrolled out so you can still see where the planets are located. If scrolled in more, give actual size of planets.

3) Add accurate texture to planets

4) Add moon orbits

5) Add comit orbits

Bugs

1) If windows resized, map gets cut off
Solved -- Created a resize event listener that reset width and height, then reset the scene and renderer

2) White outline appears when map is clicked on.

3) Orbit Controls on the 2D Renderer can get off from the solar map 
Solved --

4) Dragging with right click on the orbit controls makes the planet labels go away from their intended planet targets
Solved --

5) Intitially loading will not include planet labels, resizing window will then render them
